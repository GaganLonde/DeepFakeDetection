## Features

- ðŸŽ¨ Modern, responsive UI with smooth animations
- ðŸ“¸ Easy image upload and preview
- ðŸ¤– Machine learning-based deepfake detection
- ðŸ“Š Real-time analysis results with confidence scores
- ðŸ”„ Seamless integration between frontend and backend
- ðŸŽ¯ High accuracy in detecting manipulated images

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- React Router for navigation
- TanStack Query for data fetching

### Backend

- Python
- FastAPI
- TensorFlow for machine learning
- OpenCV for image processing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GaganLonde/deepfake-detection.git
cd deepfake-detection
```

2. Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up Python virtual environment and install backend dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:

```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

## Usage

1. Navigate to the Detect page
2. Click "Choose Image" to select an image file
3. Preview the selected image
4. Click "Analyze Image" to process the image
5. View the results showing whether the image is a deepfake and the confidence level
