frameworks:

1. React - The main frontend framework, as evidenced by the imports and use of React components (`React.FC`, `useState`)

2. React Router - For handling navigation and routing
   - Using `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, `useNavigate`
   - Used for page navigation between Landing and Detect pages

3. Framer Motion - For animations and transitions
   - Used via the `motion` components
   - Provides animations for hover effects, page transitions, and element appearances

4. Tailwind CSS - For styling
   - Evidenced by the utility classes like:
   - `bg-gradient-to-br`, `text-white`, `rounded-xl`, `flex`, etc.
   - Used for responsive design and styling throughout the application

5. React Icons - For icon components
   - Specifically using `react-icons/fa` for Font Awesome icons
   - Icons used: `FaUpload`, `FaSpinner`, `FaArrowLeft`

6. TanStack Query (React Query) - For data fetching
   - Seen in `App.tsx` with `QueryClient`, `QueryClientProvider`

Additional UI Components:
- Custom UI components from what appears to be a component library:
  - `Toaster`
  - `TooltipProvider`
  - `Sonner`

This is a modern React stack using TypeScript (as seen by the `.tsx` extension and type annotations) for type safety and better development experience.
